# **Hello!** :wave:

Hi, I'm Alex Sutherland! I am currently in my last semester
of studying computer science at Montana State University. I 
am proficient in Java and Python and familiar with C. 
Here in college I've set up a simple http server, implemented 
a genetic algorithm to the solve graph coloring problem, 
learned basic concepts of computer security, and much more.

## Fun Classes I've Taken:
- Computer Networks
- Artificial intelligence
- Advanced Software Engineering
- Computer Security


## Some of My Projects:
- **Tunings** is a python program that allows a user to 
    enter a guitar tuning and then outputs the shape of
    any scale the user would like to see. More information
    and source code and be found [here!](https://github.com/aalleexxss/Tunings.git)!
- **Sweeper** is a text based implemetation of the classic
    game Mineweeper, implemented in Java and can be found [here!](https://github.com/aalleexxss/Sweeper.git)
